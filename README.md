# Scheduling-PageReplacement-Visualizer
An interactive simulator implementing 8 CPU scheduling algorithms and Page Replacement techniques (FIFO, LRU, Optimal). Supports multiple CPU/I/O bursts, animated Gantt and Timeline charts, and compares metrics like turnaround and waiting time. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Google Charts.
